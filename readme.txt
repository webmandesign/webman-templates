Collection of pre-designed row templates for Beaver Builder page builder.


== Description ==

This plugin provides a collection of custom [**Beaver Builder** page builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) templates for WordPress themes (especially the accessibility ready themes by [WebMan Design](https://www.webmandesign.eu)).

The plugin only serves additional custom templates to Beaver Builder page builder interface, so it is not slowing down your website at all.

= Features =

* Basic collection of pre-designed row templates (under "Predesigned Rows" section)
* Adds additional collections for supported themes (see [WebMan Design themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/project-type/themes/) for more info)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It does not do anything, how come? =

= Can I set it up somehow? =

This is a simple plugin that only adds custom collections of designs into Beaver Builder page builder and there is really no need for any settings page.

If you want, you can modify the plugin with code using action and filter hooks provided.
