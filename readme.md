# WebMan Templates

Provides a collection of custom [**Beaver Builder** page builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) templates for WordPress themes by [WebMan Design](https://www.webmandesign.eu).

## Requirements

* Your theme must declare the support for the plugin
* The theme can declare support for global templates, otherwise the theme specific templates are going to added only
* Template featured images are located inside the plugin, so no calls to external URLs are made

* **MAJOR** - Created when a new theme is added (and thus a new theme templates files are added).
* **MINOR** - When a plugin functionality is added, when a theme templates files require an update.
