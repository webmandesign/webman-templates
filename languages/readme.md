# How to translate the plugin?

The best way is to translate the plugin at its [WordPress.org repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webman-templates/). Just click the "[Translate WebMan Templates into your language](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/webman-templates)" link under "_Development_" tab/section of the page.

This way you are helping others to use the plugin in your language and also contributing to open-source WordPress community. Thank you for that! :)

Alternatively, if you want to keep the translation for yourself :( you can use a [Loco Translate plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) to translate any plugin (and theme) directly within your WordPress dashboard.

## WARNING! Do not place your translation files into this folder!

Any translation files placed here, in the `webman-templates/languages` folder, will be deleted when you update the plugin. Sorry, but that is really not the correct way to translate a WordPress plugin any more.
